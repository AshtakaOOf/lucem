# Lucem 1.0.0 is here!
Yay.

# Thank you to all of these amazing people :3
* The VinegarHQ team for creating Sober (plox open source it so that I can rewrite it in Nim :3)
* @cristiandis for fixing up the README and reporting bugs
* @BrycensRanch for setting up the GitHub Actions task

You can grab the binary from here and install it wherever you fancy, preferrably in your `PATH` since this binary is self-contained. \
Actual packaging on the AUR and a Nix flake will come soon.
